# CNNsAndTransferLearning

## Convolutional Neural Networks
In one part of this project, by implementing a Convolutional Neural Network, we examined the effect of different hyper-parameters on the achieving results. These parameters are number of layers, loss functions, number of filters and used kernels, optimizers, dropout, activation functions, etc.

## Data Augmentation
By Using different techniques which are proper for exerting on images, such as Rotation, Shifting, Brightness, Shear Intensity, Zoom, Flip and so on, the data is augmented to have a balanced dataset.

## TransferLearning
In this part, the **Xception** architecture is used in order to make profits of its embedded knowledge in other task. 

More details are provided in the attached report.
